                <h2 class="kalyn-padding kalyn-animation">Growing Up</h2>
                <p class="kalyn-padding">Despite being born in San Diego, California, Kalyn has spent a majority of her
                    life here in the
                    Treasure Valley. She grew up in a very loving and fortunate household with her parents and two
                    brothers. Her family is fairly close-knit even as her siblings are growing up and moving away. </p>
                <h2 class="kalyn-padding kalyn-animation">Current Life</h2>
                <p class="kalyn-padding">Currently Kalyn still resides in the Treasure Valley. She now lives with her
                    husband, son, two cats, and German Shepherd Dog. She thoroughly enjoys her schooling and constantly learning
                    new things. She also loves dog training and is hoping to get her dog into agility and scent work
                    when he is old enough. </p>
