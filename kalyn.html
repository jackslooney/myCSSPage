                    husband, son, two cats, and German Shepherd Dog. She thoroughly enjoys her schooling and constantly
                    learning
                    new things, which is what interested her in both programming as well as the GIMM major.</p>
                <p>She has also recently gained a growing interest in dog training. Devoting her time to learn about
                    different training methods, as well as
                    the four quadrents of training. She has also learned about different sorts of enrichment activities,
                    such as puzzle/slow feeders,
                    decompression walks, and various confidence building exercises. She does all of this in order to
