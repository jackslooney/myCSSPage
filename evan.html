                <p id = "evanBio" class = "evanText">I was born in Chicago, Illinois and lived there for 5 years before moving to Boise.
                     My hobbies include rock climbing, skiing, drawing, and playing games. My family has 
                     two poodles because of sever allergies to everything among all of us. I love to travel
                      and camp whenever given the opportunity. I'd choose mountains over oceans any day and 
                      my favorite color is royal purple.
