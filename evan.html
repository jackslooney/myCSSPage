                <h2>Childhood</h2>
                <p id = "evanBio" class = "evanText">I was born in Chicago, Illinois and lived there for 5 years before moving to Boise.
                    I have one older sister that I am still very close with despite living in different states for the
                     past few years. I quickly gravitvated towards video games and legos as a child and still continue to now.
                    </p>
                <h2>Current Day</h2>
                <p id = "evanBio" class = "evanText">
                     My hobbies include rock climbing, skiing, drawing, and playing games. My family has 
                     two poodles because of sever allergies to everything among all of us. I love to travel
                      and camp whenever given the opportunity. I'd choose mountains over oceans any day.
                </p>
